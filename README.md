In the 80's I always wanted to program cool applications for my 8 bit computer but didn't get very far since I was a kid and had very few resources to learn. 

After high school I studied mechanical engineering and therefore had little to no exposure to coding myself. 

Now I'm trying to learn coding in my extremely limited free time. Wish me luck!
